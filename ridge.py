    INPUT:
    xTr:    dxn matrix - 2d numpy array (each column is an input vector)
    yTr:    1xn vector - 2d numpy array (each entry is a label)
   lambdaa: float (regularization constant)
    w:      dx1 weight vector - 2d numpy array (default w=0)

    OUTPUTS:

    reg_loss:      float (the total regularized loss obtained with w on xTr and yTr)
    gradient:  dx1 vector - 2d numpy array (the gradient at w)
